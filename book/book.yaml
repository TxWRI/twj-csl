    Contamination of unfenced streams with P, sediments, and pathogenic bacteria
    from cattle (Bos taurus) activity may be affected by the availability of
    shade and alternative water sources. The objectives of this study were to
    evaluate water quality in two streams draining tall fescue (Festuca
    arundinacea Schreb.)–common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) pastures with
    different shade distribution, and to quantify the effects of alternative
    water sources on stream water quality. For 3 yr, loads of dissolved reactive
    phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS)
    were measured during storm flow, and loads of DRP, TP, TSS, and Escherichia
    coli were measured every 14 d during base flow. We also used GPS collars to
    determine amount of time cattle spent in riparian areas. Our results showed
    that cattle-grazed pastures with unfenced streams contributed significant
    loads of DRP, TP, TSS, and E. coli to surface waters (p Ͻ 0.01). Time spent
    by cattle in riparian areas as well as storm flow loads of DRP, TP, and TSS
    were larger (p Ͻ 0.08) in the pasture with the smaller amount of nonriparian
    shade. Water trough availability decreased base flow loads of TSS and E.
    coli in both streams, and decreased time cattle spent in riparian areas in
    the pasture with the smaller amount of nonriparian shade (p Ͻ 0.08). Our
    results indicate that possible BMPs to reduce contamination from
    cattle-grazed pastures would be to develop or encourage nonriparian shade
    and to provide cattle with alternative water sources away from the stream.

    Runoff of Escherichia coli and other fecal indicator bacteria from grazing
    lands has been identified as a significant source of bacterial
    contamination. Development of best management practices to address these
    bacterial issues is critical to the success of watershed restoration efforts
    where grazing is a substantial contributor. In the present study, grazing
    management was evaluated to assess its effectiveness as a best management
    practice. Specifically, runoff from rotationally grazed and ungrazed
    approximately 1 ha pastures was monitored for more than two years using
    automated samplers. E. coli levels in runoff were enumerated by membrane
    filtration using modified membrane-thermotolerant Escherichia coli agar
    (modified mTEC). The study found that background E. coli concentrations
    (i.e., those from wildlife and soilborne naturalized strains) were
    relatively consistent among sites. Median background E. coli concentrations
    ranged from 3,500 to 5,500 colony forming units per 100 mL, which are not
    inconsequential levels related to water quality assessment and
    implementation efforts. Findings also indicated that rotational stocking, if
    timed appropriately, reduced E. coli concentrations in runoff. The impact of
    grazing timing in relation to runoff events was a more significant factor
    than stocking rate on the rotationally stocked pastures. When runoff
    occurred more than two weeks following grazing, E. coli levels were reduced
    by more than 88% compared to runoff during or soon after grazing. As a
    result, it is recommended that creek pastures and other hydrologically
    connected pastures be grazed during periods when runoff is less likely and
    that upland pastures be grazed during rainy seasons when runoff is more
    likely to occur.
